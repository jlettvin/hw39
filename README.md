Hello World! assembler
======================
# hw39
hello world assembler in 39x39

Specialized for Mac OS X only for now.

This repository explores syntax for

to illustrate similarities and diffs.

Future development on other platforms
simply needs \`uname\`.mk to exist and
have contents appropriate to its needs.
